# Flask-IDS
This is a lightweight, IDS pipeline utilized with a dashboard script to dynamically and safely display threat logs treated as text. So code in logs can not be executed by the Flask interpreter. Jinja2 is used to accomplish this as it escapes HTML logic. The IDS is standalone without any other solutions put in place, however, an IPS is simulated via the blocking of access to the admin page. Which is set to serve the "403" forbidden page by default when showcasing the project. Due to an IDS and IPS solution typically being served together.

# Features 

- The package features a Docker-ready IDS prototype pipeline stack, complete with a Flask web-server that leverages Jinja2, a dashboard with it's own dedicated environment, and an IDS engine whose I/O operations communicate with the dashboard.

- As the web service is essentially a honeypot the IDS engine is strongly configured to detect injection-based attacks in an input parameter on a form.

- The package includes a dockerfile that allows for quick, portable image and container building.

# Usage

The intended usage of this package is to demonstrate to employers the functionality of my project. It is not intended for personal or commercial benefit, however, the codebase is open to researchers who wish to reference my model. Although, optimability shouldn't be expected as this is a logical demonstration.
